### Information about the book 
This textbook on elementary particle physics, written in German, provides an introduction from the basics to modern experiments to the latest developments in particle physics. Experimental tools such as accelerators and detectors as well as the symmetry principles and their applications are also presented in detail. In addition, the Standard Model - which largely dominates today's experimental and theoretical discussion - is introduced. To this end, the book explains essential areas of quantum electrodynamics, the quark model, quantum chromodynamics and electroweak theory. The Lagrangian formalism formulates the standard model as a gauge theory and the Higgs mechanism is described in detail. Chapters on the physics of hadron colliders and neutrino physics tie in with current research and also examine possible extensions of the Standard Model in the light of recent experimental results. The appealing design of the textbook and the 187 exercises with solution instructions and supplements as Jupyter Notebooks on GitHub subsequently serve to deepen the knowledge.

### Calculations with python
The very popular programming language Python is part of the curriculum at many universities. Sympy is a computer algebra programme based on Python. In conjunction with the Jupyter notebook, it provides an elegant framework for computer algebra. Please consult the Python and Jupyter pages to install these programs on your system. On this [GitHub link](https://github.com/BuchEPP/Buch) we provide additional material for detailed calculations and solution notes for the exercises. The Python programming is intentionally kept at a simple level so that beginners in programming can get started easily.
